    @page ImmutableTaxTableBillTerm Some notes on tracking fields in gncBillTerm and gncTaxTable objects

    The gncTaxTable and gncBillTerm business objects have parent, child,
    refcount, invisible field in their structures that deserve some
    explanation:

    - a child is a 'frozen' instance of a parent.  For example, the tax
    percentage in a particular tax table may change over time, but you
    dont want that change to affect already-posted invoices...  So you
    make sure there is an immutable 'copy' (read: child) of the tax
    table when you post the invoice and repoint at the child.

    - a parent can have many children, but it will only have a 'child'
    pointer if the parent has not been modified.  Think of this as a
    copy-on-write mechanism.  posted invoices will continue to use the
    _same_ child until the parent is modified, at which point a new
    child will be created.

    - invisible means "dont show this in the list".  It's so you dont
    get all the children in the tax table list -- you only see parents.
    I suppose this flag could also be called "is-child" as I believe that
    only children can be invisible, and ALL children are invisible.

    - refcount is a listing of how many objects are referencing it.
    Basically, it's letting you know how many customer, vendor, entries,
    etc are referencing e.g. a particular tax table object.  mostly this
    was done to make sure you cannot delete an in-use taxtable.

    - children don't use refcounts, only parents do.

    - A child always points to its parent (it can have only 1).
    - A parent has a list of all children.
    - A parent has a pointer to the current 'replica child', if one exists.
